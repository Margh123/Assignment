	<b> posted on Mar 20 2021</b>
	<article> It was all began in 2018, where I sat on my old laptop with my bordom. I still remember that feeling when I turned on the computer<br>
	and were clueless on what to do. However, because of that boredom, I decided to try something that I experienced when I was a child, I downloaded <br>
	a software called Musescore because that was what I have done in my childhood time.<br>
	Well, after I had stumbled upon various UI elements such as Note Input, Pallete, Inspector I somehome felt the influency in my music writing. To be <br>
	more specific, I input note so quick and not so many mistakes were made, I checked the time that I have done composing my first song, it was not <br>
	time-consuming. I then realized that, the User Central Design of Musescore is extremely intuitive, one that I can point out is the <b>Note Input System</b><br>
	which basically aided my so much when it comes to composing. <br>
	Then days passed, I felt like I want to composing a song on ocassion. However, the disaster came when the quality of the music is not so perfect. I then <br>
	switch to arranging instead and fortunately, my effort was compensated. I published my first arranged song named "Katy Katy" by Lam Truong and received many <br>
	compliments. There was a trick actually, that I only shared this to Musescore.com flatform that song in order to get well-known and with the combination of <br>
	Piano group on Facebook, the song got more views.<br>
	Currently, I still arrange music but the different is that I make money from it and it is an achievement that builds my confident in music. Another thing I <br>
	would like to show is that, this webpage allows you to request an arrangment for a song as long as you provided valid information. </article>
